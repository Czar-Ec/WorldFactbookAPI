# WorldFactbookAPI
This is kind of an experimental API that I am using to learn Spring Framework as well as hosting APIs on my Raspberry Pi.
In future this API might be used for future projects, since I am planning ZEUS Mk II

## Purpose
The API provides country information. An application/person can query the API for specific country data and the API returns JSON objects that the requester can then parse for the returned information. I am also planning on hosting this on Docker on a raspberry pi so should be able to handle requests across a LAN.

## Layout
Currently it is a skeleton, and so far have small items on it, however I am expecting it to have a way of periodically scanning a specified file system so that it updates the available country data.

## Contributing
You may ask me to be a contributor, otherwise you can fork the repository and make a pull request. If you are already a contributor, please ensure that you make a new branch every change you add, that way we can CRTL + Z if something goes wrong
