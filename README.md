# Doomed to exterminatus
We have arrived, and it is now that we fulfill our charge. In fealty to the God-Emperor (our Undying Lord), and by the grace of the Golden Throne, I declare exterminatus upon the Imperial repository WorldFactbookAPI. I hereby sign the Death Warrant of an entire repository, and consign a million code to oblivion. May Imperial justice account in all balance. The Try-Catch protects.
